Why use reForge?
================

Need to simulate a large biomolecular complex? Or even many?
------------------------------------------------------------

Then reForge is the right tool. If offers a (*almost*) pain-free setup for Martini+CG Protein/RNA/Lipid complexes.

This performance gain is impressive even for a medium-sized system of about 1000 residues. 
Imagine scaling up to hundreds or thousands of systems!


Tools for Custom Model Development
------------------------------------

Build your own models and integrate them with existing MD engines and analysis tools.
