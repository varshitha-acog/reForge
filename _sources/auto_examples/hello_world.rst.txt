One of the motivations behind reForge was to provide a user- and beginner-friendly interface
for managing potentially hundreds or thousands of MD simulations without having to switch 
between multiple scripts and constantly rewriting them—all while staying within comfort of Python.
This is what the 'cli' module is for:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 24-26

.. code-block:: Python

    from reforge.cli import run, sbatch, dojob








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 27-29

The idea is very simple: suppose you have "n" mutants and you need to perform "n" independent runs 
for each mutant to achieve sufficient sampling.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 29-32

.. code-block:: Python

    systems = [f'mutant_{i}' for i in range(4)]
    mdruns = [f'mdrun_{i}' for i in range(4)]








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 33-34

The functions run, sbatch, and dojob allow you to execute the same script for all cases:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 34-38

.. code-block:: Python

    for system in systems:
        for mdrun in mdruns:
            run(f'echo "Hello, I\'m run {mdrun} of {system}"')








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 39-40

Alternatively, you can call run like this:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 40-44

.. code-block:: Python

    for system in systems:
        for mdrun in mdruns:
            run('echo', 'Hello, I\'m run', f'{mdrun} of {system}')     








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 45-47

Alternatively, you can sbatch a script. This command passes all positional arguments to the script 
and keyword arguments to the SLURM scheduler.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 47-52

.. code-block:: Python

    if 0:  # Set to 1 to actually submit jobs.
        for system in systems:
            for mdrun in mdruns:
                sbatch('hello.sh', mdrun, system, mem='50M', t='00:00:01', partition='htc', qos='public')   








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 53-54

By default, output is written to "slurm_jobs/output_file" and "slurm_jobs/error_file".

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 54-60

.. code-block:: Python

    outfiles = [f for f in Path('slurm_jobs').glob('*output*')]
    for fpath in outfiles:
        with open(fpath, 'r') as file:
            # Print only the first line of each output file.
            print(file.readline(), end='')

For convenience, dojob will either submit or run the script based on its first argument.
In this case, we do not want to sbatch the script.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 63-67

.. code-block:: Python

    submit = False
    for system in systems:
        for mdrun in mdruns:
            dojob(submit, 'hello.sh', mdrun, system, mem='50M', t='00:00:01', partition='htc', qos='public')
