Why use reForge?
================

Need to simulate a large biomolecular complex? Or many?
-------------------------------------------------------

Then reForge is the right tool. Pain-free setup of Martini+CG Protein/RNA/Lipid complexes
(https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-53098-4)

Python-based
------------

Everything is included and python-based.

- ** Just one python (actually two) scripts is all you need:**  
  Need to run tens or hundreds of MD simulations and analyse them? reForge can do it!
  And with the press of just one button.

Accelerated C- and CUDA routines
--------------------------------

- **Process terabytes of data like WHOOOOSH:**

  Just look at this massive performance gain compared to standard Python and NumPy.

  And this is for a medium sized system of only ~1000 residues. 
  Imagine processing hundreds or thousands of these.
